* Logger line
* Chassis relative velocity steering
* Arm cartesian position steering
* _Arm cartesian angle steering_

* 2D map of obstacles (storing)
* _Camera view_ and _Object detection frames_
* _Camera turret steering_
* _Camera arm position_


## _Logging_
There should be nonvolatile data logged on PC and on Field Mainframe.


## Video proccesing
